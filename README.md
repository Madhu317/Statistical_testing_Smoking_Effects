# Statistical_testing_Smoking_Effects
Statistical testing to find out how smoking influences death rate based on age group 

##Problem Statement
The Problem of our experiment is to find out how smoking influences death rate with respect to age factor.

##Description and Purpose
Our experiment is aimed at analyzing the effects of smoking on the death of an individual with respect to age. This problem is scientifically significant because if there is a direct relationship between smoking and death rate in a specific age group, we can imply the correlation between deaths of individuals who smoke versus the non-smoking ones.  Also, we can analyze the trend of deaths due to this habit over the ages and raise awareness. If there is no direct correlation existing from our experiment, the study must be extended to analyze the cause of the death and if there is any other predominant disease that prevails that needs to be made aware of.


The data to be used in our analysis was available from the study that was conducted by two scientists who were researching on the relationship between humans smoking habit and reason of deaths caused due to smoking.
